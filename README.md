<h1> The Origin </h1>

  <p> The first chickens arose from the domestication of a red jungle fowl somewhere in Southeast Asia some 8,000 years ago. Soon after, chicken spread to India and China and from there the chicken was born. Nowadays, <i>Gallus Domesticus</i>, as the chicken is known scientifically, is found all over the world.</p>
<p> The humble origins of the chicken may make one believe that they are no longer important. <strong> That would be wrong. </strong> Chicken remains one of the most important domesticated animals that humanity farms today. </p>

<h1> Farming Chicken </h1>
<p> Today, more than 50 billion chicken are raised around the world. For what purpose you may ask? For meat and eggs of course! Unfortunately, many chickens are raised in factory farms where they are mistreated. So be nice and buy free-range chickens. Typically, factory chickens raised for meat are killed at 6 weeks while free-range chickens are killed at 14. Chickens are also raised for eggs, with some breeds of chicken even producing over 300 eggs per year. </p>

<h1>The Life Cycle of the Chicken</h1>
<p> The chicken has a very normal life cycle for what it is. Evolutionarily speaking, birds, like the chicken, evolved from dinosaurs, meaning that birds, just like dinosaurs, lay eggs. While humans enjoy eating unfertilized chicken eggs, when a chicken egg does get fertilized, it will hatch into a chicken after 20-21 days of incubation. After which, a little chick (the word for a baby chicken) will emerge. </p>
