<h1> An Opening Word</h1>
    <p> In this short guide on how to raise a chicken, I am going to make a few assumptions. For one, I am assuming that you are interested in raising a chicken as a hobby or reading this just to learn something new. I am assuming that you are <strong>NOT</strong> trying to mass raise chickens or raise them to make a giant profit. Because if you are, then you are trying to become a chicken farmer and I suggest you research this on a different website. That aside, this guide is enough to learn the basics of raising a chicken for fun, and even for a few eggs every once in a while.</p>
<h1> How to Raise a Chicken </h1>
    <ol>
      <li> Step One: Get Your Supplies. To raise a chicken you will need many supplies including, but not limited to:
          <ul>
            <li> A coop (large enough for whatever number of chickens you want)</li>
            <li> Nesting boxes for hens to lay eggs in (roughly 1 hesting box for every 3 hens)</li>
            <li>A roost for your chickens in the coop (and a droppings board under the roost to keep the coop more clean)</li>
            <li>A run with enough space outside for your chickens to roam around (if there are predators like hawks in your area, make sure to cover the run with a roof)</li>
            <li>Feed for the chickens to eat (Remember that every age of chicken has different nutrient needs)</li>
            <li>Clean drinking water for your chickens (if in a cold climate the drinker will need to be heated)</li>
            <li> Grit such as small rocks and stones for the chickens to break down their food</li>
            <li>A chicken first aid kid to help your chickens if they get hurt</li>
          </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Step Two: Choosing the Age of Your Chickens.
        <p> It is really important to figure out how you want to get your chickens before you buy them. Make sure to research how much work you want to put in before buying your chickens. Your choices are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Eggs: This <strong>will</strong> require special equipment and more effort.</li>
          <li>Chicks: Much simpler than raising eggs, and lets you get to know your chickens from a young age</li>
          <li>Pullets: Lets you skip the egg-raising process, though pullets are in an awkward teenage stage and won't produce eggs.</li>
          <li>Adults: Completely skips the raising process and goes straight into a fully adult rooster or egg-laying hens.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Step Three: Choosing the Breed of Your Chickens.
        <p>Choosing the breed of your chickens is very important because different breeds have different qualities. Some are friendlier and more outgoing, some are better equipped to handle extreme heat or cold, and some produce more eggs then others. Here are some breeds to choose from:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>Orpingtons: Larger, cold-hardy birds that tend to be friendly</li>
           <li>Easter Eggers: Hybrid Chickens that lay blue and green eggs, very friendly, smart, heat tolerant, and cold-hardy</li>
           <li>Golden Comets:friendly, very productive egg layers, short lifespan</li>
           <li>Marans:Large, good egg layers, cold hardy</li>
           <li>Wyandottes: Curious, cold-hardy, good egg layers</li>
         </ul>
      </li>
      <li> Step Four: Get your Chickens and Enjoy.
        <p>Remember the basics, and learn more as you get more and more interested in the chicken keeping hobby. And remember to have fun!</p>
