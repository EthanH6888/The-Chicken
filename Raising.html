<h1> An Opening Word</h1>
    <p> In this short guide on how to raise a chicken, I am going to make a few assumptions. For one, I am assuming that you are interested in raising a chicken as a hobby or reading this just to learn something new. I am assuming that you are <strong>NOT</strong> trying to mass raise chickens or raise them to make a giant profit. Because if you are, then you are trying to become a chicken farmer and I suggest you research this on a different website. That aside, this guide is enough to learn the basics of raising a chicken for fun, and even for a few eggs every once in a while.</p>
